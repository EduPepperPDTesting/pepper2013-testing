单一登录服务 URL
https://login.windows.net/0397bdf1-4ff9-47e5-8aae-33a6c04b6c50/saml2

单一注销服务 URL
https://login.windows.net/0397bdf1-4ff9-47e5-8aae-33a6c04b6c50/saml2


登录 URL (可选)
https://59.45.37.45
包含此应用程序的基于 Web 的登录页面的 URL。如果应用程序配置为执行服务提供商启动的单一登录，
则当用户导航至此 URL 时，服务提供商将进行必要的重定向，以对应用程序中的用户进行身份验证和日志记录。

例如，当用户导航至我的应用门户并点击应用程序磁贴时，他们将被重定向到配置为登录 URL 的 URL。

URL that contains the web-based sign-in page for this application. If the application is configured to perform service provider-initiated single sign on,
then when a user navigates to this url, the service provider will do the neccessary redirections to authenticate and log on the user in the application.

For example when a user navigates to my apps portal and clicks on the application tile, they will be redirected to the url configured as Sign On Url.



颁发者 URL
https://59.45.37.54
此颁发者 URL 应单独标识应用程序正在设置哪个单一登录。通常，这也是 azure 将发送回应用程序作为身份验证令牌的“访问群体”的值。
The issuer URL should uniquely identify the application for which single sign on is being setup. Typically this is also a value that azure will send back to application as 'audience' of authentication token and the application is expected to validate it.



回复 URL
https://59.45.37.54/genericsso
回复 URL 是应用程序期望接收身份验证令牌的地方。这也被称为“断言使用者服务” (ACS) URL。

The reply URL is where the application expects to receive the authentication token. This is also referred to as the "Assertion Consumer Service" (ACS) URL.





Hi Pavel,

I found something strange of azure sso, or it's my misunderstanding.

My url settings:

Click on the app icon:

It opens a tab and redirect to
http://59.45.37.54/login

Question 1:
I think the sign on url is used when SSO is initiated on SP side,
so what we need here is directing to http://59.45.37.54/genericsso
I'm right? If so, how to make it?

Question 2:
It direct to http://59.45.37.54/login (It changes https to http).
If I remove "login" from the setting (set to https://59.45.37.54)
Then this won't happen. Know something about this?
